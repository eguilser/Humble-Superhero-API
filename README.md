## Overview üìù
**Humble Superhero API** is split into two main parts:
1. **Backend (NestJS)** ‚Äì Creates the API, stores data in-memory, and handles endpoints.
2. **Frontend (React)** ‚Äì Provides a user interface to add superheroes and see them listed in real time.

The project demonstrates:
- **POST /superheroes**: Add a superhero (validates `humilityScore` is between 1 and 10).
- **GET /superheroes**: Fetch and sort the list by highest humility score first.

## If I Had More Time‚Ä¶ ‚è≥
Database Integration: Instead of in-memory, connect to MongoDB or PostgreSQL so data persists across restarts.
Authentication: Add JWT-based authentication for protected routes or an admin panel.
Unit & E2E Tests: Expand coverage for both backend (controller, service) and frontend (React testing).
Deploy: Containerize with Docker and push to AWS or Heroku. Or set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
Enhanced UI: Use a design system like Material UI or Chakra UI, include filters/sorting by superpower or name.
